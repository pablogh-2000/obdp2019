abstract = "With the ever growing capabilities of space-grade FPGAs and microcontrollers, spacecraft systems are evolving from centralized architectures with a single main processing unit to decentralized layouts composed of multiple intelligent nodes. The backbone of this development is the command and control bus that interconnects these units. Used in terrestrial applications since decades, the CAN bus provides performance and robustness similar to other more traditional spacecraft buses such as MIL-STD-1553, but at very low cost. The European Cooperation for Space Standardization has published a standard in mid 2015 that specifies the requirements for a CAN bus system for space application. In this paper we present the details and results of a prototype implementation of this standard for CubeSat missions. We demonstrate that the minimal implementation of this protocol stack can well be adapted to the tight constraints of microcontrollers. The main advantages of this standardized CAN bus are increased reliability and higher data throughput, as compared to other commonly employed bus systems on CubeSats."

At present, no single computing scheme satisfies both, the highly reliable operation requirement and the high-performance computing requirement. The aim of this paper is to review existing systems and offer a new approach to addressing the problem. In the first part of the paper, a detailed survey of fault-tolerant distributed computing systems for space applications is presented. Fault types and assessment criteria for fault-tolerant systems are introduced. Redundancy schemes for distributed systems are analyzed. A review of the state-of-the-art on fault-tolerant distributed systems is presented and limitations of current approaches are discussed. In the second part of the paper, a new fault-tolerant distributed computing platform with wireless links among the computing nodes is proposed. Novel algorithms, enabling important aspects of the architecture, such as time slot priority adaptive fault-tolerant channel access and fault-tolerant distributed computing using task migration are introduced."

abstract="Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) image compression techniques have been utilized in most of the earth observation satellites launched during the last few decades. However, these techniques have some issues that should be addressed. The DWT method has proven to be more efficient than DCT for several reasons. Nevertheless, the DCT can be exploited to improve the high-resolution satellite image compression when combined with the DWT technique. Hence, a proposed hybrid (DWT--DCT) method was developed and implemented in the current work, simulating an image compression system on-board on a small remote sensing satellite, with the aim of achieving a higher compression ratio to decrease the onboard data storage and the downlink bandwidth, while avoiding further complex levels of DWT. This method also succeeded in maintaining the reconstructed satellite image quality through replacing the standard forward DWT thresholding and quantization processes with an alternative process that employed the zero-padding technique, which also helped to reduce the processing time of DWT compression. The DCT, DWT and the proposed hybrid methods were implemented individually, for comparison, on three LANDSAT 8 images, using the MATLAB software package. A comparison was also made between the proposed method and three other previously published hybrid methods. The evaluation of all the objective and subjective results indicated the feasibility of using the proposed hybrid (DWT--DCT) method to enhance the image compression process on-board satellites.",
